Hello!

I’m excited to be finally begin sharing content out with the world. I have had a strong interest in personal finance and investing and want to share the knowledge that I’ve gained along the way.

Working as a designer and software developer, I have a passion about coming into this space to create content and resources for people that is approachable and accessible. Good design goes far beyond something being “pretty”. As I tackle new design problems, reducing resistance for a user as they utilize a tool or digest content can greatly improve how they actually implement that information into their everyday life.

Personal finance, budgeting, credit cards, investing, and more – I hope that you enjoy the upcoming videos and posts, and I would love to hear about any specific topics you would like to hear more about!

I’ll keep this intro short, but I look forward to hearing your thoughts. See you soon!

– Seth
