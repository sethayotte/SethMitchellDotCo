Having a sufficient emergency fund is an essential first step for financial security - and it should not be ignored. 2020 was a prime example of how a bizarre circumstance can pop up when we least expect it and have a drastic impact on our lives. I recently heard the statistic from the Federal Reserve:

> 40% of Americans cannot afford to cover a $400 emergency expense

In the event of an unplanned medical emergency, auto or home repair — or a global pandemic, it can be very easy for a family to be wiped out without any other choice but to take on debt.

While saving for retirement, investing in stocks, or even taking a vacation, if you can't support yourself during a surprise expense, you likely shouldn't be putting money into these other things. An emergency fund, apart from high-interest debt, should be your first priority while getting your finances in shape.

### My Personal "Emergency" Expense

Trust me, this is not a fun step, but you will thank yourself down the road. This money, unlike other savings, is not for a new car, clothes, or travel — but "life" expenses that will inevitably come up. A personal example of this, I recently discovered that my plumbing needed to be redone in order for it to function properly. Even though I had no idea that this was going to be an issue 6 months ago, it cost me close to $5,000.

I chose this topic to write about because of my recent situation that proves my point. Even though the process of hiring a plumber to diagnose my issue and give me an estimate of what it would cost to fix was not fun, being properly prepared with an emergency fund allowed me to not have to sell any investments or use a credit card that accrued interest.

### How Much Should You Have Saved?

If you do additional searching about emergency funds, you will likely see a variety of numbers and ways to calculate. The most common figure that I hear, and a good rule of thumb, is 3-6 months of your expenses.

Why 3-6 months? While there can be one-off car or medical emergencies that can be costly, having a month range in your mind is in case anything happens to your regular monthly income. In the event that you are laid off or cannot work due to injury and do not receive pay, your 3-6 month fund will give you some time in order to find another job or survive until you can replace that income somehow.

For example, let's say the following items are your monthly recurring expenses:

* Rent: $1,200
* Utilities: $125
* Food: $300
* Car & Gas: $250
* Phone: $75

With each of these expenses, our total for recurring *necessary* expenses is $1,950. By "necessary", I mean no frivolous spending like going out to a bar or shopping online. These expenses are what you have to pay to survive.

A 3-6 month emergency fund for mandatory monthly expenses of $1,950 would be $5,850 - $11,700. Looking at this number head on, it can definitely be intimidating. It can also take quite a while to achieve. It may be helpful to break it up into smaller chunks. To start, focus on saving just *one* month of expenses. It will definitely feel good and will motivate you to keep going.

### Getting 3 Months of Expenses Saved

The longer you wait to get started, the more likely you are to have an unexpected situation pop up that requires you to shell out more money than you have on hand. I don't mean to scare you, but it's important to understand the importance. Again, you will thank yourself down the road.

There are likely a number of things that you spend money on month to month that are not essential. Taking a look through a credit or debit card statement to see where your money is going may surprise you. Spending a ton on Amazon or getting takeout most nights instead of cooking at home can really add up. Here, you will have to be honest with yourself about what you are overspending on and be disciplined about stopping. It may be tough to cut out these things, but you will be surprised how quickly the money can build up when you cut back to essentials only. It will be a good illustration of how much money is getting tossed out on things that you don't really need.

Getting to 3 months of expenses saved may take 6 months, or 12 months, or more. It really depends on how much extra money you make over and above your necessary expenses. When you hit that 3-month fund mark, celebrate! You are in a much more secure financial position. At this point, it is ok to treat yourself, but just make sure that you continue to tuck away money to head for 6 months.

### Setbacks and Temptations

Along the way, you might encounter an unexpected expense. You've been working hard and have $3,250 saved up and on the way home from work, you get a flat tire. After getting it towed and replaced, you're back down to $2,925. Don't be discouraged! If anything, this just proves why you need to keep working on building up for an emergency.

On the other side of the coin, you've been working hard and have close to $4,000 saved up and you decide to buy a new phone when your current one works just fine. $1,100 later, you've possibly erased months of diligent saving. If an emergency comes up and requires you to pay $3,500, you no longer have that ready in cash. After using a credit card and paying interest as you continue to save up again, that phone's actual cost just became a whole lot more expensive!

While you may see the number continue to grow in your savings account, you should not consider it to be money that you can spend. Unless absolutely necessary, you should not withdraw any money.

Even when you've achieved 3 or 6 month status — as expenses pop up unexpectedly, get into the mindset that rather than pulling from your fund, try to forego a few nights out to dinner in order to pay for a doctor visit copay or a new kitchen appliance.

### Wrapping Up

This is the tough first step. Once you succeed, you will feel much better about your financial future and can begin getting into the more fun things the world of personal finance has to offer!
